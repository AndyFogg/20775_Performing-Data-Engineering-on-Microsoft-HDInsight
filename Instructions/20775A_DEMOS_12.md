# Module 12: Developing Real-time Processing Solutions with Apache Storm

## Demo 1: Monitoring and managing a Storm cluster 

### Scenario

In this demonstration, you will see how to:
-  Start a sample topology.
-  Use the Storm UI.
-  Use Storm commands.

### Preparation

Before starting this demonstration, you should build a Storm cluster. This might take 15-20 minutes to deploy.
1.  Ensure that the **MT17B-WS2016-NAT**, and **20775A-LON-DEV** virtual machines are running, and then log on to **20775A-LON-DEV** as **Admin** with the password **Pa55w.rd**.
2.  On the **20775A-LON-DEV** virtual machine, start Internet Explorer®.
3.  In the address bar, type **http://portal.azure.com** and sign in using the Microsoft account that is associated with your Azure Learning Pass subscription.
4.  In the Azure Portal, in the left pane, click **+ Create a resource**.
5.  Click **Analytics**, and then click **HDInsight**.
6.  On the **HDInsight** blade, click **Custom (size, settings, apps)**.
7.  On the **Basics** blade, enter the following values, and then click **Next**:
    -  **Cluster name**: storm\<*your initials\>\<ddmmyyyy*\> (where \<*ddmmyyyy*\> is the current date)
    -  **Subscription**: your subscription
    -  **Cluster type**:
        -  **Cluster type**: Storm
        -  **Operating system**: Linux
        -  **Version**: Storm 1.1.0 (HDI 3.6)
    -  **Cluster login name**: admin
    -  **Cluster login password**: Pa55w.rd123
    -  **Secure Shell (SSH) username**: sshuser
    -  **Use same password as cluster login**: selected
    -  **Resource Group (Create new)**: rgModule12
    -  **Location**: your location
8.  On the **Security + networking** blade, click **Next**.
9.  On the **Storage Account Settings** blade, under **Select a Storage account**, click **Create new**.
10. In the **Create a new Storage account** box, type **sa\<*your initials\>\<ddmmyyyy*\>**, and then click **Next**.
11. On the **Applications (optional)** blade, click **Next**.
12. On the **Cluster size** blade, set the **Number of Supervisor nodes** to **2**, and then click **Next**.
13. On the **Script actions** blade, click **Next**. 
14. On the **Cluster summary** blade, click **Create**.
15. Wait for the cluster to be provisioned before proceeding with the demonstration. This may take 15–20 minutes.
16. Click **All resources**, click **storm\<*your initials\>\<ddmmyyyy*\>**, and then show the status as **Running**.

### Start a sample topology
>Note: The commands in this demo can be copied from **E:\\Demofiles\\Mod12\\StormCmds.txt**.

1.  On the **storm\<*your initials\>\<ddmmyyyy*\>** blade, under **Settings**, click **SSH + Cluster login**.
2.  On the **SSH + Cluster login** blade, copy the **Host name** to the clipboard.
3.  Click **Start**, type **putty**, and then click **PuTTY**.
4.  In the **PuTTY Configuration** dialog box, in the **Host Name (or IP address)** box, type the following (replacing **storm\<*your initials\>\<ddmmyyyy*\>** with the name of your cluster), and then click **Open**:
    ````
    sshuser@storm<your initials><ddmmyyyy>-ssh.azurehdinsight.net
    ````
5.  In the **PuTTY Security Alert** dialog box, click **Yes**.
6.  In the PuTTY terminal window, type **Pa55w.rd123**, and then press Enter.
7.  Run the following command to start a bash shell as the superuser:
    ````
    sudo bash
    ````
8.  Run the following command to start the topology running:
    ````
    storm jar /usr/hdp/current/storm-client/contrib/storm-starter/storm-starter-topologies-*.jar org.apache.storm.starter.WordCountTopology wordcount
    ````
9.  After a few minutes, the topology will start running, and can be monitored.

### Use the Storm UI
1.  In the Azure Portal, on the **storm\<*your initials\>\<ddmmyyyy*\>** blade, click **Overview**.
2.  In the **Cluster dashboards** section, click **Ambari home**.
3.  In the **Windows Security** dialog box, enter the following credentials, and then click **OK**:
    -  **User name**: admin
    -  **Password**: Pa55w.rd123
4.  In the Ambari console, in the left menu, click **Storm**.
5.  On the Ambari Storm page, click **Quick Links**, and then click **Storm UI**.
6.  In the **Cluster Summary** section, point out the Storm version, the number of supervisors, the number of used/free/total slots, the number of executors (instances of a component), and the number of tasks.
7.  In the **Nimbus Summary** section, point out the Host address of each Nimbus node, and which node is currently Leader, and the uptime.
8.  In the **Topology Summary** section, point out the topology name, its status, the uptime, the number of workers/executors/tasks, the replication count, and assigned memory.
9.  In the **Supervisor Summary** section, point out the host address of each Supervisor node, the uptime, the number of used/available/total slots, and the used memory.
10. In the **Nimbus Configuration** section, point out the configuration information, and show that this is very detailed and continues over several pages.
11. In the **Topology Summary** section, click **wordcount** to open a new page focused on the topology.
12. In the **Topology actions** section, click **Deactivate**.
13. In the **Message from webpage** dialog box, click **OK**.
Explain that the topology has now been paused.
14. In the **Topology actions** section, click **Activate**.
15. In the **Message from webpage** dialog box, click **OK**.
Explain that the topology has now been resumed.
16. In the **Topology actions** section, click **Kill**.
17. In the **azurehdinsight.net needs some information** dialog box, type **10**, and then click **OK**.
18. After 10 seconds, the Storm UI page will show a status of **KILLED** for the topology.
19. Switch to the SSH session.
20. In the PuTTY terminal window, run the following command to start the topology:
    ````
    storm jar /usr/hdp/current/storm-client/contrib/storm-starter/storm-starter-topologies-*.jar org.apache.storm.starter.WordCountTopology wordcount
    ````
21. After a few minutes, the topology will start running again.
22. Wait a few minutes, and then refresh the Storm UI page. If the page shows an internal server error, close the Storm UI tab, and then repeat steps 5 and 11 to reopen it.
23. Wait until the Storm UI page shows a status of **ACTIVE** for the topology, before proceeding with the demo.

### Use Storm commands
1.  Switch to the SSH session.
2.  In the PuTTY terminal window, run the following command:
    ````
    storm list
    ````
    Point out that the status should be **ACTIVE**. Also point out the number of tasks and workers, and the uptime. Note the number of workers.
3.  In the PuTTY terminal window, run the following command:
    ````
    storm monitor wordcount
    ````
    Point out the components.
4.  In the PuTTY terminal window, run the following command:
    ````
    storm monitor wordcount -m count
    ````
    Point out the real-time statistics.
5.  Press Ctrl+C to stop the monitoring.
6.  In the PuTTY terminal window, run the following command (replacing **\<workers\>** with the number of workers you noted in step 2 above + 2; that is, if you noted 3 workers in step 2, use 5 in the following command):
    ````
    storm rebalance wordcount -n <workers>
    ````
7.  In the PuTTY terminal window, run the following command:
    ````
    storm list
    ````
    Point out that the number of workers has now increased. If the **Status** is **REBALANCING**, run the command again until the **Status** is **ACTIVE**.
8.  In the PuTTY terminal window, run the following command:
    ````
    storm kill wordcount -w 15
    ````
9.  In the PuTTY terminal window, run the following command:
    ````
    storm list
    ````
10. Verify that the topology is no longer running.
11. Close the SSH console.
12. In Internet Explorer, close the Storm UI and Ambari tabs.

>**Note**: When you have finished the demo, you should delete the resource group to remove all HDInsight resources.
