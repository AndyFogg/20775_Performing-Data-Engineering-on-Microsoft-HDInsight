# Module 1: Getting Started with HDInsight

## Lab: Working with HDInsight

### Exercise 1: Provision an HDInsight cluster and run MapReduce jobs

#### Task 0: Prepare the environment

1.  Ensure that the **MT17B-WS2016-NAT**, **20775A-LON-DEV** virtual machines are running, and then log on to **20775A-LON-DEV** as **Admin** with the password **Pa55w.rd**.

2.  Using File Explorer, navigate to **E:\\Labfiles\\Lab01**, right-click **Setup.cmd**, and then click **Run as administrator**.

3.  In the **User Account Control** dialog box, click **Yes**.

4.  Close File Explorer.

#### Task 1: Create an HDInsight cluster and run a word count MapReduce job

1.  On the **Start** menu, type **Windows PowerShell ISE**, and then press Enter.

2.  In Windows PowerShell ISE, on the **File** menu, click **Open**.

3.  In the **Open** dialog box, browse to **E:\\Labfiles\\Lab01**, click **Create-and-Run-WC.ps1**, and then click **Open**.

4.  On the **File** menu, click **Run**.

5.  Follow the instructions given in the PowerShell window.

6.  When the cluster has been created, press Enter to run the word count MapReduce example.

#### Task 2: Run a YARN job

1.  On the Start menu, type **Command Prompt**, and then press Enter.

2.  At the command prompt, type **putty**, and then press Enter.

3.  In the **Putty Configuration** dialog box, in the **Host Name (or IP address)** box, enter the host name. The host name can be found in the PowerShell output from the previous exercise, for example ***your_cluster_name*-ssh.azurehdinsight.net**.

4.  Under **Connection type**, click **SSH**, and click **Open**.

5.  In the **PuTTY Security Alert** dialog box, warning that the host certificate cannot be verified, click **Yes**.

6.  At the **login as** prompt, type **sshadmin**, and then press Enter.

8.  In the SSH console, enter the following commands to find the current Hadoop version:
    ````
    cd ..

    cd ..

    cd usr/hdp

    ls
    ````

9.  In the SSH console, enter the following command to view the unsolved Sudoku puzzle. Replace **\<currentHadoopversion\>** with the version number listed from the previous step:
    ````
    cat /usr/hdp/<currentHadoopversion>/hadoop/src/hadoop-mapreduce-project/hadoop-mapreduce-examples/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/examples/dancing/puzzle1.dta
    ````

10. In the SSH console, enter the following command to solve the Sudoku puzzle. Replace **\<currentHadoopversion\>** with the version number listed as per the previous step:
    ````
    yarn jar /usr/hdp/current/hadoop-mapreduce-client/hadoop-mapreduce-examples.jar sudoku /usr/hdp/<currentHadoopversion>/hadoop/src/hadoop-mapreduce-project/hadoop-mapreduce-examples/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/examples/dancing/puzzle1.dta
    ````

11. Close PuTTY.

12. In the **PuTTY Exit Confirmation** dialog box, click **OK**.

13. Close the Command Prompt.

#### Task 3: Delete the resource group

1.  In Windows PowerShell ISE, on the **File** menu, click **Open**.

2.  In the **Open** dialog box, browse to **E:\\Labfiles\\Lab01**, click **DeleteRG.ps1**, and then click **Open**.

3.  On the **File** menu, click **Run**.

4.  In the **Confirm** dialog box, click **Yes**.

    The deletion process can take a few minutes, please wait until the process is complete.
