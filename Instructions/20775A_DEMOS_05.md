    ````dos
    yarn jar /usr/hdp/current/hadoop-mapreduce-client/hadoop-mapreduce-examples.jar wordcount /example/data/gutenberg/davinci.txt /example/data/davinciwordcount
    ````
2.  When the MapReduce job has finished, in the PuTTY console, type the following command, and then press Enter:
    ````dos
    yarn application -list -appStates FINISHED
    ````
3.  If the results of this command show the **Total number of applications** as **0**, repeat the command until at least one application is reported.
4.  When the **Total number of applications** reports one or more applications, use the mouse to copy the application ID from the console display to the clipboard; this ID will be of the form: _application_1496062917453_0003_. 
5.  In the PuTTY console, type the following command, and then press Enter (replacing **\<applicationId\>** with your copied ID):
    ````dos
    yarn logs -applicationId <applicationId> > wordcount.log
    ````
6.  Switch to the Command Prompt.
7.  At the command prompt, type the following command, and then press Enter (replacing **\<clustername\>** with the name of your cluster):
    ````dos
    pscp -pw Pa55w.rd123 sshuser@<clustername>-ssh.azurehdinsight.net:/home/sshuser/wordcount.log e:/Logfiles/yarn/
    ````
