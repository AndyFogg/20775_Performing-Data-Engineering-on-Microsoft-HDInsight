### Create an HDInsight cluster by using the Azure Portal

1.	On the **20775A-LON-DEV** virtual machine, on the Start menu, start to type **Internet Explorer**, and then click **Internet Explorer**.
2.	In the address bar, type **http://azure.microsoft.com**, click **Portal**, and then sign in using the Microsoft account that is associated with your Microsoft Learning Azure Pass subscription.
3.	In the Azure Portal, click **All resources**, and then verify that there are no existing HDInsight clusters in your subscription. 
4.	In the Azure Portal, in the left pane, click **+ New**.
5.	Click **Data + Analytics**, and then click **HDInsight**.
6.	On the **New HDInsight Cluster** blade, click **Custom (size, settings, apps)**.
7.	On the **Basics** blade, type the following details, and then click **Cluster type**:
    -	Cluster name: **\<your name\>\<date\>**
    -	Subscription: **\<your subscription\>**
8.	On the **Cluster configuration** blade, enter the following details, and then click **Select**:
    -	Cluster type: **Hadoop**
    -	Operating system: **Linux**
    -	Version: **(Leave at default)**
    -	Cluster tier: **STANDARD**
9.	On the **Basics** blade, enter the following details:
    -	Cluster login username: **hadmin**
    -	Cluster login password: **Pa55w.rdPa55w.rd**
    -	Secure Shell (SSH) username: **sadmin**
    -	Use same password as cluster login: **not selected**
    -	SSH authentication type: **PASSWORD** 
    -	SSH password: **Pa55w.rd**
    -	Resource group (create new): **hadooprg**
    -	Location: **Select your region**
10.	On the **Basics** blade, click **Next**.
11.	On the **Storage** blade, under **Select a Storage account**, click **Create new**.
12.	In the **Create a new Storage account** box, type **\<your name\>\<date\>sa**; point out that this name must be globally unique.
13.	In the **Default container** box, replace the suggested name with the name of your cluster (for example, **\<your name\>\<date\>**).
14.	Leave all other settings at their defaults, and then click **Next**.
15.	On the **Applications (optional)** blade, click **Next**.
16.	On the **Cluster size** blade, in the **Number of Worker nodes** box, type **1**.
17.	Click **Worker node size**.
18.	On the **Choose your node size** blade, click **View all**, click **A3 General Purpose**, and then click **Select**.
19.	Click **Head node size**.
20.	On the **Choose your node size** blade, click **View all**, click **A3 General Purpose**, and then click **Select**.
21.	On the **Cluster size** blade, click **Next**.
22.	On the **Advanced settings** blade, click **Next**.
23.	On the **Cluster summary** blade, point out the estimated cost per hour of this cluster. Remind students that, to avoid using up their Azure Pass allowance, it is important that they remove clusters when they are not using them.
24.	On the **Cluster summary** blade, click **Create**.
25.	Wait for the cluster to be provisioned and the status to show as **Running**.
26.	On the **HDInsight cluster** blade, under **PROPERTIES**, click **Properties**, and then point out the detailed properties of the cluster.
27.	On the **HDInsight cluster** blade, under **CONFIGURATION**, click **Scale Cluster**, and then point out that you can dynamically scale the number of cluster nodes to meet processing demand.
28.	On the **HDInsight Cluster** blade, click **Overview**, and then click **Dashboard**.
29.	When you are prompted, log in as **hadmin** with a password of **Pa55w.rdPa55w.rd**.
30.	Explore the dashboard for the cluster. Explain that the dashboard is an Ambari web application in which you can view and configure settings for the Hadoop services running in the cluster. 
31.	When you are finished, close the dashboard tab and return to the Azure Portal tab.

### Delete the HDInsight cluster and storage account

1.	In the Azure Portal, click **Resource groups**. 
2.	On the **Resource groups** blade, click the resource group that contains your HDInsight cluster (**hadooprg**).
3.	On the **Resource Group** blade, click **Delete**. 
4.	On the **Confirmation** blade, type **hadooprg**, and then click **Delete**.
5.	Wait for your resource group to be deleted, click **All resources**, and then verify that the cluster, and the storage account that was created with your cluster, have both been removed. 
6.	Close the browser.

>**Note:** As soon as an HDInsight cluster is running, the credit in your Azure subscription will start to be charged. The free trial subscription includes a credit limit of approximately **USD100** (or local equivalent), which you can spend over a period of 30 days. This is enough to complete the labs in this course, providing that clusters are deleted when they are not in use. If you decide not to complete this lab, follow the instructions in the last exercise of the lab to delete your cluster and avoid using your Azure credit unnecessarily.

## Demo 2: Using PowerShell to create and delete HDInsight clusters

### Scenario

In this demonstration, you will see how to:
-	Create an HDInsight cluster by using Azure PowerShell.
-	Delete a cluster by using Azure PowerShell.

### Preparation

Before you can perform the demonstration, you will need to run the **E:\Demofiles\Mod02\Setup.cmd** file.

### Create an HDInsight cluster by using Azure PowerShell
