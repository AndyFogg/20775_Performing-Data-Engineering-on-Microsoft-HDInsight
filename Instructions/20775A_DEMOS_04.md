### Managing storage using the Azure CLI

In the previous topic, you created a Blob storage account, an ADLS account, and uploaded data using the portal. In this demonstration, you will perform the same operations but use the Azure CLI instead.
1.	Ensure that the **MT17B-WS2016-NAT**, **20775A-LON-DEV** virtual machines are running, and then log on to **20775A-LON-DEV** as **Admin** with the password **Pa55w.rd**.
2.	Open a command prompt.
3.	Authenticate your Azure subscription by running the following command: 
    ```dos
    azure login
    ```
4.	If the **Select y to enable data collection** prompt appears, press **n**. 
5.	Follow the login prompt to authenticate using web browser by visiting **https://aka.ms/devicelogin**, and then log in using your Azure credentials. 
6.	To see the subscriptions associated with your email account, run the following command:
    ```dos
    azure account list
    ```
7.	If you have multiple subscriptions, use the following command to select the subscription youâ€™d like to use:
    ```dos
    azure account set "<Subscription Name>"
    ```
8.	Ensure the **Microsoft.DataLakeStore** resource provider is registered by running the following command:
    ```dos
    azure provider register --namespace Microsoft.DataLakeStore
    ```
9.	Update the datacenter location and name to create a resource group in your subscription:
    ```dos
    Azure group create -l eastus2 -n <RGName>
    ```
10.	Provide a name for your storage account. Run the following command to create an Azure Storage account:
    ```dos
    azure storage account create -l eastus2 -g <RGName> --sku-name GRS --kind BlobStorage --access-tier Hot <storageaccountname>
    ```
11.	Get the connection string for this storage account using the following command:
    ```dos
    azure storage account connectionstring show <storageaccountname> -g <RGName>
    ```
12.	Run the following command to create a container named clidata in your newly created Blob storage account:
    ```dos
    azure storage container create clidata --connection-string <ConnectionString>
    ```
13.	Navigate to **E:\Demofiles\Mod04\clidata\hvac** in your terminal window. 
14.	Run the following command to upload the file to your storage accountâ€™s clidata container:
    ```dos
    azure storage blob upload -f HVAC.csv â€“-container clidata -c <ConnectionString>
    ```
15.	Run the following command to list the blobs in your clidata container:
    ```dos
    azure storage blob list â€“-container clidata â€“c <ConnectionString>
    ```
16.	Navigate to **E:\Demofiles\Mod04\clidata\Building** in your terminal window. 
17.	Run the following command to upload the file to your storage accountâ€™s clidata container:
    ```dos
    azure storage blob upload -f building.csv â€“-container clidata -c <ConnectionString>
    ```
18.	Run the following command to list the blobs in your clidata container:
    ```dos
    azure storage blob list â€“-container clidata â€“c <ConnectionString>
    ```
19.	You uploaded two blobs, **hvac/HVAC.csv** and **building/building.csv**. These files have information about the temperature of multiple office buildings. Now you want to upload the HVAC data to an Azure Data Lake Store.
20.	Create a new ADLS account using the following command: 
    ```dos
    azure datalake store account create -n <ADLSName> -l eastus2 -g <RGName>
    ```
21.	Navigate to **E:\Demofiles\Mod04\clidata\hvac** in your terminal window. 
22.	Upload **HVAC.csv** to ADLS:
    ```dos
    azure datalake store filesystem import -n <ADLSName> -p HVAC.csv -d clidata/hvac/hvac.csv
    ```
23.	List the files in the hvac folder to verify the upload:
    ```dos
    Azure datalake store filesystem list -n <ADLSName> -p clidata/hvac
    ```
24.	This is the end of the demonstration and you will now delete the resource group:
    ```dos
    azure group delete -n <RGName>
    ```
25.	To confirm the deletion, at the prompt, press y.
26.	Close the command prompt.
